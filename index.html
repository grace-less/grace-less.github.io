<p>While we hope you do check back we cannot provide a time estimate for our completion. The Boss decided to implement the proposed plan for "IP over Avian Carriers" without reading through the necessary updates. If you would like to know more or try to figure out a time estimate yourself, look into RFC 1149. GOOD LUCK!
